                <h1>How to Use</h1>
                
                <p>A guide to using Rootify to help you discover more of the stuff you want and already listen to.</p>

                <h1>The Tree</h1>
                <p> The tree shows the your top five most listened-to artists and tracks. On the left half, the tracks are represented by squares with the album art, while on the right half the artists are represented by circles with the artist image. </p>

                <img src="/assets/rootify.png">
                <p>In the top bar there are two options for viewing top artists and tracks. The short-term button will display your tree with the top artists and tracks according to your activity of the past four weeks. The long-term button will display the tree with the same information except it will base off of your activity of the past six months. </p> 
                
                <img src="/assets/rootify.png">
                <p> Clicking on the downward arrow underneath any of the tracks or artists will branch out the tree and show three more tracks or artists related to the one that whose arrow was clicked. The tree can be extended further for any subsequent arrows. </p>
                
                <img src="/assets/rootify.png">
                <p>Clicking on an upward arrow will collapse all of the connected rows beneath the arrow. Reopening that arrow will expand all of the rows that had been minimized. Clicking the reset tree button will collapse all rows in the tree except for the first row containing the top five tracks and artists. Resetting the tree will cause all of the related tracks and artists to have to be manually opened again if you wish to see them after resetting the tree.</p>
                
                <img src="/assets/rootify.png">
                <h1>The Filter Bar</h1>
                <p>On the bottom there is a green box with a white upward arrow. Clicking on that will bring up a filtering bar with options to resize and filter any tracks or artists according to popularity, energy, danceability, and happiness. Clicking on the green box with a downward arrow will minimize the bar. </p>
                
                <img src="/assets/rootify.png">
                <p>Checking one or more of the boxes under resizing tracks & artists will cause all of the artists and tracks in the tree to resize according to the checked boxes. Tracks will resize for a combination of any of the four checkboxes, however artists will only resize when popularity is checked as they do not have a rating for any of the other categories. </p>
                
                <img src="/assets/rootify.png">
                <p>A smaller overall rating will result in a smaller representation in the tree. The sliders underneath the filter tracks & artists can be adjusted from either end to see which tracks and artists fall into the range of the sliders. Any artists or tracks that do not fulfill the slider criteria will become grayed out. </p>

                <h1>Side Bar</h1>
                
                <img src="assets/rootify.png">
                <h1>Details Tab</h1>
                <p>On the right lays a sidebar with a details tab and generate tab. When details is selected, clicking on a track will highlight its square outline in orange and display a player that gives a short preview of the song and displays the rating for popularity, energy, danceability, happiness, and the key for each song. Clicking on an artist will highlight its circle outline in orange and will bring up previews for up to three top tracks in the United States for that artist. It also displays the popularity rating and the genres associated with the artist.</p>
                
                <img src="assets/rootify.png">
                <h1>Generating a Playlist</h1>
                <p>When generate is selected, up to five artists, tracks and genres can be selected to generate a playlist. Any of the artists and tracks in the tree can be selected and will be outlined in orange if they had been most recently selected. They will be outlined in green if they are in the generate list, but were not the most recent selection. Artists and tracks can be removed from the selected list by clicking the red “x” next to their names. </p> 
                
                <img src="assets/rootify.png">
                <p> Artists and tracks that are not in the tree can be searched up and added to the list of selections. The search bars for the tracks and artists will display the latest entry that was put into the selection list for each of their respective categories. Any artists or tracks in the tree that were selected using the searches will have their squares or circles highlighted accordingly.</p>
                
                <img src="assets/rootify.png">
                <p>Genres can be searched up, but will not appear in the in the selected list with the tracks and artists. They will remain within their search bar in a list. Genres can be removed by clicking the gray “x” next to their names in their list. </p>
                    
                <p>The four sliders under filtering options will be factored in when creating the playlist by filtering out the tracks whose ratings do not fall in the ranges specified by all four sliders. </p>
                    
                <p>Clicking the generate playlist button at the bottom of the tab will bring up a dialogue box asking for the a name for the new playlist and the number of tracks to be put in the playlist. Leave the name blank will cause the playlist to take on a default name which is “[Rootify] Playlist”. The minimum number of tracks in the playlist will be based off of the number of tracks in the selected list with one being the lowest if there are zero or one tracks in the selected list since the tracks in the selected list will become a part of the playlist. The maximum number of tracks is fifty, but a generated playlist can have less tracks than this amount depending on filtering options. Once the name and number of tracks has been selected click the generate playlist button in the dialogue box. The dialogue box will disappear once the playlist is created and the tracks in the playlist will appear as a list underneath the filtering sliders. The playlist will also be added directly into the user’s list of playlists on Spotify.</p>
